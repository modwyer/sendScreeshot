Automated launch of mstsc, take a screenshot and email it

This was a 'I wonder if I can make this work' project.  I had a Debian VM server running on a server that was blocked from sending messages.  Each day I would remote in to check the status of what was running on there.  I was learning Python and wondered if I could write something in Python to automate my process of remoting in and checking the status.  I made this little script (using parts of others I found online) to automate launching Remote Desktop and connecting to the server, taking a screenshot once Remote Desktop is connected, and then emailing me that screenshot.
